Challenge Description: I've always wanted a private jet - fly whenever I want and enjoy such a luxurious experience with no babies crying and yelling. Their private jet is pretty cool, so I took a picture when they landed back in January. I want to know where they flew FROM in *January *becuase that's where I want to travel to next! Flag format (name of the country they flew from): wsc{country}

Challenge Solution: So it was the easy one for me. Looking at the picture we can see "Khaled and Reem" on the plane. And then google it, and what country the Prince visit more often

Result: wsc{switzerland}, that is our flag

Flag: wsc{switzerland}
