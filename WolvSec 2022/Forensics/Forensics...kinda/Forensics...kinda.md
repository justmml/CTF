Challenge Description: This image has been a bit shifty - can't seem to find the message my friend encoded in it!

Challenge Solution: Here we're given png file with slides. But in fact, I don't know if I'm able to upload it to my git (I'll ask soon if it is ok). I tried zsteg. It is a Command-line tool for use against Least Significant Bit steganography... unfortunately only works against PNG and BMP images.

zsteg Forensics_kinda.png

Result: wsc{g0_blu3}, that is our flag

Flag: wsc{g0_blu3}
